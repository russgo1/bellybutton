<!--Always make sure that your files are linked correctly and in the right order. 
    Since Roza needs the Plotly CDN to use Plotly, the CDN <script> tag should come first. 
    Since she will also need the data to load before using Plotly, the data file should be linked next. 
    Finally, the script file is linked.-->
